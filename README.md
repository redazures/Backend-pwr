Hello,

This is the back end of a React Native Front end.
Please check out the following link for a video demo:
https://www.loom.com/share/63272b1563624b8e96c413eb1918cd0e.

The front end of the application will need this back end to run.
Running this backend, getting the localhost id for the front end, and running the front end should run the application smoothly.

Please read the front end of the application on how to get the data from the rails server.

Please note that this is the front end of the application:

Thank you for reading this readme.

Best Regards,

James Wu
